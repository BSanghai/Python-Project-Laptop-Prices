# Python-Project-Laptop-Prices
This project leverages the “Laptop Prices” dataset from Kaggle to explore various factors influencing laptop pricing. Key objectives include calculating the average laptop price, identifying brands with the highest average prices, and examining the correlation between specifications (like RAM size and processor type) and laptop prices.

The analysis further investigates the distribution of prices, identifies outliers, and evaluates how storage types (SSD vs. HDD) impact prices. Finally, a predictive model is created.

The project showcases essential data science skills, including data cleaning, statistical analysis, data visualization, correlation analysis, and machine learning. Overall, it provides valuable insights into laptop pricing dynamics, aiding consumers and businesses in decision-making.
